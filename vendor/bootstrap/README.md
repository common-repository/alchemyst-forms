# Alchemyst Forms SCSS Compilation Instructions
This folder is designed to provide a very straight forward and basic implementation of a few very particular bootstrap components for use with Alchemyst forms. This will ensure compatibility with the "Apply Bootstrap Classes" functionality that the input builder utilizes for better looking forms. Without this, the forms will look very plain if your theme does not have great form styles out of the box.

Credit (mostly) for this setup goes to Larry Geams: https://github.com/larrygeams/bootstrap-gulp

Autoprefixer added for compatibility concerns.

# Customizing Your Own Bootstrap Styles
Some theme options will be made available in the Wordpress admin for some basics, but you can also override the entire structure by moving the vendor/bootstrap/ folder to your theme to a subfolder `alchemyst/bootstrap/`
